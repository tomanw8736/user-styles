<h1 align="center">Tom's User Styles</h1>

<p>
    These are themes (userstyles) that I've written. It won't be a continuos project.</br>
    Whenever I make a new one I'll upload it here.
</p>

<h2 align="center">Requirements</h2>
<p>
    These themes require Stylus, a userstyle manager for Chrome and Firefox.
